# CoRSIV Probe Set Configuration
# Correlated Regions of Systemic Interindividual Variation

name: CoRSIV
description: "Probes in Correlated Regions of Systemic Interindividual Variation - methylation marks that show consistent patterns across tissues within individuals"

# Scientific rationale
rationale: |
  CoRSIV probes are selected because they exhibit correlated methylation patterns
  across different tissues within the same individual. This property makes them
  ideal for developing blood-based biomarkers that can predict methylation
  status in less accessible tissues (like sperm).
