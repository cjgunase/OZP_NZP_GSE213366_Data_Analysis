# Control Probes Configuration
# EPIC array control/reference probes

name: Controls
description: "Control probes from the Illumina EPIC array for quality control and normalization reference"

# Scientific rationale
rationale: |
  Control probes serve as reference markers on the EPIC array. They can be used
  as negative controls in classification experiments to establish baseline
  performance, or for quality control assessment of array performance.

# Probe information
n_probes: ~850
array_platform: Illumina EPIC (850K)

# Data files for each dataset (relative to project root)
files:
  GSE213366: data/raw/GSE213366_Controls.csv

# Selection criteria
selection_criteria:
  method: "Pre-defined array controls"
  source: "Illumina EPIC manifest"

# Feature selection for classification
feature_selection:
  method: none  # Use all control probes (or variance filtering)
  variance_threshold: 0.01

# Recommended analyses
recommended_for:
  - quality_control  # QC assessment
  - negative_control  # Baseline comparison for classification
  - normalization  # Reference for data normalization
