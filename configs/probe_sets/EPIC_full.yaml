# Full EPIC Array Probe Set Configuration
# All probes from Illumina EPIC array

name: EPIC_full
description: "Complete Illumina EPIC array probe set (~850,000 probes) for comprehensive methylation analysis"

# Scientific rationale
rationale: |
  The full EPIC array provides comprehensive genome-wide methylation coverage.
  Use this probe set for unbiased discovery analyses, genome-wide association
  studies, or when you want to identify novel biomarkers without restriction
  to pre-defined probe subsets.

# Probe information

# Recommended analyses
recommended_for:
  - dmr_analysis  # Differentially Methylated Region identification
  - epigenome_wide_association  # EWAS
  - discovery  # Novel biomarker discovery
  - visualization  # Gene-level methylation plots

# Memory considerations
notes: |
  Full EPIC matrix is very large (~2.6 GB). Consider:
  - Using chunked reading for memory efficiency
  - Pre-filtering probes before loading
  - Using compressed file formats
